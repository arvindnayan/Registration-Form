Tkinter is a python library for developing GUI (Graphical User Interfaces).
We use the tkinter library for creating an application of UI (User Interface), to create windows and all other graphical user interfaces.

If you’re using python 3.x(which is recommended), Tkinter will come with Python as a standard package, so we don’t need to install anything to use it.
